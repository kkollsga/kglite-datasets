//! Identity-table population.
//!
//! Identity tables (Company, Person, Security, InstitutionalManager)
//! hold entity identifiers — they don't carry a provenance footer
//! because identities are derived from many filings, not single
//! facts. The strategy:
//!
//! - **Company.csv** is populated up-front from `submissions.zip`
//!   (one row per CIK we have submission data for). That covers
//!   every issuer / filer in scope.
//! - **Person, Security, InstitutionalManager** are populated
//!   incrementally as form extractors encounter them. The
//!   `Identities` struct holds per-run dedup HashSets so each entity
//!   is emitted exactly once per extraction run.
//!
//! Form extractors call `identities.ensure_person(sinks, nid, name, cik)`
//! every time they reference a person. If the person is new this run,
//! a row is written to `person.csv`; otherwise the call is a no-op.
