"""Investor use-case tests for the SEC EDGAR knowledge graph.

Ten plausible queries that investment teams run against SEC filings,
each with timing instrumentation. Env-gated like the live integration
test — set ``KGLITE_SEC_INTEGRATION=1`` to enable. The module shares
a single graph across all tests via a session-scoped fixture so the
~4 second build cost is paid once.
