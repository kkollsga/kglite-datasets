"""Phase 9: live SEC integration test.

Gated behind the ``KGLITE_SEC_INTEGRATION`` env var so the default
``pytest`` run stays fully offline. To enable:

    KGLITE_SEC_INTEGRATION=1 \\
        KGLITE_SEC_USER_AGENT="Your Name your@email.com" \\
        pytest kglite/datasets/sec/tests/test_integration_live.py -xvs

Builds a tiny SEC-backed graph (one year of master.idx + a synthetic
submissions.zip for a handful of well-known CIKs) and runs real
queries against it. The submissions.zip is synthesised locally
because the bulk file from SEC is ~5GB — too large for a routine
integration test.
